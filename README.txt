Blockchain Tutorials Repository

This repository contains my notes, code snippets, and practice files from a comprehensive Ethereum & Blockchain Development course (25+ hours, 19 sections, 298 lectures).
It covers everything from Blockchain basics and Solidity to ERC20, ERC721, Truffle, HardHat, Foundry, Web3.js, NFTs, and ERC4337 Smart Wallets.

Topics Covered
• Blockchain & Smart Contract Basics
• Remix IDE setup & Solidity fundamentals
• MetaMask, Ethereum transactions, and Gas
• Payable, fallback, and receive functions
• Structs, Mappings, Exceptions, and Low-Level Calls
• Web3.js, Events, and Listeners
• ERC20 Token Standard & Token Sale Implementation
• ERC721 NFT deployment & OpenSea integration
• Truffle framework & Ganache
• HardHat development & testing
• Foundry (Forge) unit testing & deployment
• ERC4337 Smart Accounts (Account Abstraction)

How To Use

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-tutorials.git
cd blockchain-tutorials
```

Open any section folder and review the .sol contracts and notes.md.
For Truffle/HardHat/Foundry projects, navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:
```
npm install
# or for Foundry
forge install
```

Run tests or scripts depending on the framework used.

Purpose
This repository is for learning, experimenting, and building a strong foundation in blockchain development.
It will grow over time as I move through the course and expand with personal improvements and projects.
